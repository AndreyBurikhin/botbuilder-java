/**
 A method that can participate in delete activity events for the current turn.
 
 @param turnContext The context object for the turn.
 @param reference The conversation containing the activity.
 @param next The delegate to call to continue event processing.
 @return A task that represents the work queued to execute.
 A handler calls the <paramref name="next"/> delegate to pass control to
 the next registered handler. If a handler doesnâ€™t call the next delegate,
 the adapter does not call any of the subsequent handlers and does not delete the
 activity.
 <p>The conversation reference's <see cref="ConversationReference.ActivityId"/>
 indicates the activity in the conversation to replace.</p>
